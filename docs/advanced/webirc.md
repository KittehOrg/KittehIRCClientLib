*Please note that some server software refers to the WebIRC protocol as cgiirc in configuration files.*

KICL supports the WEBIRC command which is used for indirect connections such that the IRC server is made aware of the user's own IP address. For example, consider a webchat client. Without WebIRC support, all connections made through the web client would appear to originate from the webserver's IP address. With WebIRC support, the (trusted) webchat client sends the following information on connect:

* A password that is kept secret between the IRC server and the client requesting the spoofing.
* The name of the client doing the proxying and requesting the spoof (e.g. this is 'qwebirc' for Iris and 'KiwiIRC' for Kiwi IRC). This is given as the `user` argument.
* The hostname of the user connecting to the proxy.
* The user's IPv4/IPv6 address.

KICL supports version 1 of the specification, documented [here](https://kiwiirc.com/docs/webirc). The code sample below shows how to configure KICL to send a WEBIRC command on connect. In the example, "MyBot" is the name of the client requesting the spoof.

```
InetAddress ip = ...; // User's IP address
Client client = Client.builder().webirc("password", "MyBot", "host", ip).build();
```
